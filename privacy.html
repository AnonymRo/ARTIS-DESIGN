      <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information
        that
        could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal
        data
        extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political
        opinions,
        genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
      <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a
          way
          that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
        <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that
          purpose.
          Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
        <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
        <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of
          their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they
        collect
        and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for
        breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At ARTIS-DESIGN we strongly believe that your data
        privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the
        requirements of this new regulation.</p>
